% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- %
\section{A Cache-oblivious OBDD implementation} \label{sec:implementation}
The algorithms above have been implemented using the TPIE library \cite{TPIE}
specifically designed for algorithms and data structures on massive data. This
library provides a cache-oblivious and parallelised sorting algorithm and a
cache-oblivious priority queue of \cite{Sanders01}, together with a framework to
modularise all the algorithms above.

The resulting library of \emph{C}ache-\emph{O}blivious \emph{O}BDD
\emph{M}anipulation has been dubbed \textsc{Coom}\footnote{Coincidentally
  ``coom'' apparently also is a scottish noun for ``soot'', ``smut'', and
  ``dust'', which seems very fitting for a project that revisits and
  \emph{dusts} off an old paper.} and can be found at the following url.
